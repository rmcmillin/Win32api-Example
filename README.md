# Win32api-Example
A simple win32api example

## Description
Mostly boiler plate code with some dialogs and buttons - just some example code for anyone learning how to put a win32api application together.

## Compile
See make.bat
This is not a make file - it's a windows batch file.  I've just name it make because I'm so used to typing that to compile.
Compile using visual studio developer command prompt (part of visual studio)
First a resource file is created using rc and then the program is compiled.
